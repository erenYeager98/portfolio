    People often ask for one of these. Here ya go.
    <div class="exp">
      My passion for computers began in 3rd grade, when I got my first PC. What started as excitement for gaming quickly evolved into a deep curiosity about how software works. That curiosity led me to explore Python and Java, build desktop applications, and gradually expand into Android development, backend systems, and automation.
Today, I'm a software developer with hands-on experience across Android, Windows, and Linux platforms. I've designed and developed intuitive GUI applications using PyQt5 and JavaFX, and built reliable backend systems with PHP, MySQL, REST APIs, and solid system design practices.
I have a strong understanding of OOP principles, advanced Java, and SQL, gained through academic projects and real-world implementations. In addition, my interest in cybersecurity has led me to work on web application penetration testing, network protocol analysis, log monitoring, and incident response.
With a blend of development and security expertise, I bring a well-rounded skill set that's ready to take on complex technical challenges-be it building robust applications, securing systems, or automating workflows.

    If you have any questions about me or you just want to send me a joke,
    take a look at any of my profiles listed on this site.

    Thanks for reading this far. In exchange for your seemingly undying
    loyalty, here is a joke: Why are mountains so funny? Because they're hill
    areas.
